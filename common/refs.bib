   abstract = {Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors constitute the largest family of eukaryotic signal transduction proteins that communicate across the membrane. We report the crystal structure of a human β2-adrenergic receptor-T4 lysozyme fusion protein bound to the partial inverse agonist carazolol at 2.4 angstrom resolution. The structure provides a high-resolution view of a human G protein-coupled receptor bound to a diffusible ligand. Ligand-binding site accessibility is enabled by the second extracellular loop, which is held out of the binding cavity by a pair of closely spaced disulfide bridges and a short helical segment within the loop. Cholesterol, a necessary component for crystallization, mediates an intriguing parallel association of receptor molecules in the crystal lattice. Although the location of carazolol in the β2-adrenergic receptor is very similar to that of retinal in rhodopsin, structural differences in the ligand-binding site and other regions highlight the challenges in using rhodopsin as a template model for this large receptor family.},

	abstract = {Since the first edition of this chapter in 1972, impressive development has occurred in the ‘state of the art’. We then noted the lack of authoritative data, and tried to assemble some fragments from a variety of sources: their deficiency has been largely remedied by the major study of England and Wales carried out from Nuffield College, Oxford in 1972 (Goldthorpe et al. 1980), extended in some respects to 1983 (Goldthorpe and Payne, 1986). The British Election studies, reworked by Heath et al. (1985), now provide a complementary source: in particular it allows comparison of the social mobility of women with that of men. The paradigm of analysis that we sketched in 1972 has been superseded by developments of log-linear modelling, which at that date was little known and less used by sociologists. As a result, the literature on social mobility has become even more complex technically: fortunately there is now an excellent substantive introduction and review (Heath, 1981), while the basic elements of log-linear models are covered by Gilbert (1981). In this chapter we summarise some of the main findings on trends in England and Wales, then discuss a related, but as yet unresolved, question — whether it is appropriate to treat industrial societies as homogeneous units.},

The objective is to sum up the common procedures during the formalization and analysis of a biological problem from the perspective of Systems Biology, which approaches the study of biological systems as a whole. We begin by presenting the definitions of (biological) system and model. Particular attention is given to the meaning of mathematical model within the context of biology. Then, we present the process of modeling and analysis of biological systems. Three stages are described in detail: conceptualization of the biological system into a model, mathematical formalization of the previous conceptual model and optimization and system management derived from the analysis of the mathematical model. All along this work the main features and shortcomings of the process are analyzed and a set of rules that could help in the task of modeling any biological system are presented. Special regard is given to the formative requirements and the interdisciplinary nature of this approach. We conclude with some general considerations on the challenges that modeling is posing to current biology.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
